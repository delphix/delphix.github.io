<p>All contributors are required to sign the Delphix Contributor agreement prior
to contributing code to an open source repository. This process is handled
automatically by <a href="http://cla-assistant.io">cla-assistant</a>. Simply open a pull
request and a bot will automatically check to see if you have signed the
latest agreement. If not, you will be prompted to do so as part of the pull
request process.</p>

<h1 id="company-contributor-license-agreement">Company Contributor License Agreement</h1>

<p>In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions from any person or entity, Delphix Corp. (“Company”) must have a
Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) on file that has been signed by each
Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is
for Your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Company and
its users; it does not change Your rights to use Your own Contributions for
any other purpose.</p>

<p>This CLA allows either an individual or an entity (the “Corporation”) to
submit Contributions to Company, to authorize Contributions submitted by its
employees or agents to Company (in the case of a Corporation), and to grant
copyright and patent licenses thereto.</p>

<p>If You have not already done so, please complete and sign. This can be done
automatically through the GitHub pull request process, or by scanning and
emailling a PDF file of this CLA to
<a href="mailto:open-source@delphix.com">open-source@delphix.com</a>. Please read this
document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.</p>

<p>Name of Individual or Corporation: __________________________________________</p>

<p>GitHub Username: __________________________________________</p>

<p>E-Mail: __________________________________________</p>

<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present
and future Contributions submitted to Company. Except for the license granted
herein to Company and recipients of software distributed by Company, You
reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Definitions.</p>

    <p>“You” (or “Your”) shall mean you as an individual (if you are signing this CLA
 on your own behalf) or the Corporation (if the person signing this CLA is
 acting on behalf of the Corporation) that is making this CLA with Company. For
 legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that
 control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are
 considered to be a single Contributor and this CLA shall apply to
 Contributions by all such entities. For the purposes of this definition,
 “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
 management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
 of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
 ownership of such entity.</p>

    <p>“Contribution” shall mean the code, documentation or other original work of
 authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work,
 that is intentionally submitted by You to Company for inclusion in, or
 documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Company (the
 “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form
 of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Company or its
 representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
 mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
 that are managed by, or on behalf of, Company for the purpose of
 discussing and improving the Work, but excluding any communication that is
 conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a
 Contribution.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
 CLA, You hereby grant to Company and to recipients of software distributed by
 or on behalf of Company a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
 royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
 works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
 Contributions and such derivative works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA,
 You hereby grant to Company and to recipients of software distributed by or on
 behalf of Company a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-
 free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
 have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that
 are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
 Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
 submitted. If any person or entity institutes patent litigation against You or
 any other person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
 lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have
 contributed, constitutes direct or indirect patent infringement, then any
 patent licenses granted to that person or entity under this CLA for that
 Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You represent that You have sufficient rights and are legally entitled to
 grant the above licenses with respect to each Contribution. If this CLA is
 being made on behalf of the Corporation, the individual signing this CLA
 represents that he or she is authorized to do so on behalf of the Corporation
 to enter into this CLA, and the Corporation represents further that each
 employee or agent of the Corporation designated by it is authorized to submit
 Contributions on behalf of the Corporation. If You are making the Contribution
 as an individual, and if Your present or past employer(s) or other entities
 for whom you have performed work has rights to intellectual property that You
 create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received
 permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer or such other
 entity, that Your employer or such other entity has waived such rights for
 Your Contributions to Company, or that Your employer or such other entity has
 executed a separate CLA with Company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation
 (see section 8 for submissions that are not Your original creation).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the grant of the rights in sections 2 and 3, You acknowledge and
 agree that we may license Your Contributions under any license, including
 copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary license.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to
 the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free,
 for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
 writing, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
 WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
 without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
 MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
 submit it to Company separately from any Contribution, identifying the
 complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
 (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
 agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
 work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You agree to notify Company of any facts or circumstances of which You
 become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This CLA and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of
California without regard to application of conflicts of law rules or
principles. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this CLA
will be a court of competent jurisdiction in San Mateo County, California, and
both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any
such actions. If this CLA is modified or updated by Company, Company will
notify You of such update(s) on the Company GitHub portal, and you will be
asked to agree to the updated terms at the time your next pull request is
submitted.</p>
