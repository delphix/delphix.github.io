<h1 id="delphix-open-source-community-guidelines">Delphix Open Source Community Guidelines</h1>

<p>The community is an essential part of supporting and extending the Delphix
platform. Delphix regularly creates new platform integrations and tools that
extend the platform and makes them available through open source. We want to
ensure that all of our users can discover, use, support, and evolve those
integrations. And when you do, we want them to find a welcoming, diverse, and
inclusive community to be a part of.</p>

<p>These guidelines cover interaction between Delphix and communities, and within
communities that are formed around open source contributions from Delphix.
They do not cover contributions from Delphix professional services or
partners, nor do they cover other aspects of the broader Delphix community,
such as user groups or partner programs.</p>

<h2 id="community-conduct">Community Conduct</h2>

<p>All community members and Delphix employees must abide by the
<a href="code-of-conduct.html">Delphix Code of Conduct</a>. Each
repository has one or more Delphix maintainers accountable for
the success of the project and the community. This includes enforcing the code
of conduct, responding to issues, supporting external community leaders, and
managing contributions. Community members may be added as additional
maintainers at the discretion of existing maintainers. In the event that
concerns cannot be resolved through those representatives, please email
<a href="open-source@delphix.com">open-source@delphix.com</a> to contact the community
leadership team.</p>

<h2 id="availability-of-source-and-artifacts">Availability of Source and Artifacts</h2>

<p>All source code is made available through GitHub repositories, and is freely
accessible to all. These repositories are created within the Delphix
<a href="http://www.github.com/delphix">GitHub organization</a>, and are visible on
<a href="http://delphix.github.io">delphix.github.io</a>. Every project is licensed
under an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">OSI-approved license</a>,
with Apache 2.0 being the preferred standard.</p>

<p>All releases are tagged using GitHub releases. Release artifacts, if present,
should be made available through GitHub releases. Artifacts may also be made
available through other means, such as package managers specific to third
party tools.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>All projects must include a <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file that describes the purpose of the
project, how to get the software, and how to use it. The readme file must
include links to this set of guidelines as well as the
<a href="code-of-conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.</p>

<p>In the event that additional documentation is necessary, projects may use the
repository wiki or hosted documentation such as
<a href="http://readthedocs.io">readthedocs</a>. Any such documentation must be linked
from the readme.</p>

<h2 id="support">Support</h2>

<p>All projects must include the
<a href="statement-of-support.html">Delphix Statement of Support</a>
in the readme and wherever the software may be acquired.</p>

<p>Delphix customers with a standard support agreement have access to Delphix
support who troubleshoot to ensure that all licensed components of the
platform are working as designed. If the community extension is the source of
the issue, customers will be directed to the appropriate community channel for
support. If assistance is required to modify or alter the extension, customers
can engage with community partners, contact Delphix services for additional
help, or make contributions themselves. Support agreements through partners or
with Delphix services may vary.</p>

<p>If you find a known issue with a project, please submit a GitHub issue for the
appropriate repository. Maintainers will respond within a reasonable
timeframe, but there are is no guaranteed response time, and no commitment to
fix all issues. You can also use GitHub issues to submit feature requests.</p>

<p>If you have general questions that are not known to be a defect or a feature
request, ask our community through the
<a href="http://community.delphix.com">Delphix Community Forums</a>.</p>

<h2 id="certification-and-testing">Certification and Testing</h2>

<p>Delphix does not proactively test or certify open source extensions with each
new product release. You may want to perform your own testing prior to
updating components in mission critical scenarios. Each project should have
its own development and testing strategy to ensure high quality across
updates. This should include leveraging stable APIs to ensure compatibility
with new product releases.</p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

<p>All contributions must be made as pull requests to the appropriate repository.
All discussion around the pull request should happen on GitHub, though offline
conversations may be required when more extensive discussions are required.
Maintainers will accept pull requests after they have been reviewed and
approved. Every effort will be made to respond and iterate in a timely
fashion, though no specific guarantees are made.</p>

<p>All external contributors must sign the
<a href="contributor-agreement.html">Delphix Contributor Agreement</a> prior to
submitting any pull request.</p>
